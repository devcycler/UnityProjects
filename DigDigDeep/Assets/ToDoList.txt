//List of Concept Ideas
Fast paced clicker game with a goal to get the "gold" at the end of the level





//DONE LIST*************************************************
///////different tile materials will require different number of clicks to clear			//DONE 05 April 2019
///////have the game slowly scroll up, causing a sense of urgency in the player				//DONE 04 April 2019
///////need to add a GameManager script to track points earned.								//DONE 05 April 2019
///////tiles will be worth points, thicker tiles=  more points,								//DONE 06 April 2019
///////tiles will need to be "cleared" to get the points.									//DONE 06 April 2019
///////add level "themes" (ice world, fire world, etc)                                      //DONE 15 April 2019

//TO DO LIST-----------------------------------------------

continue button with a 30second ad to continue progress?
power ups to help the player (purchases)
steam pockets, lava, monsters/animals that will "kill" the player

have a "floating" pickaxe represent the player hitting the tiles each time? Can play the animation on the point of click
have a limited amount of times the player can dig per day, follow up with ads to add more "lives" 

eventually we can add an "elevator" type graphic to "explain" the levels?
as the player "goes down" in the levels, the "Floor Number" would be the level
old, wiregate style elevator opening at the start of the level

needs X points per level to move on
tiles getting to the top will subtract point values

able to collect diamonds/super currency to buy power ups
able to buy super currency

add "cracking" effects to sprites when clicked
add "dust" effect when clicked
add "wiggle" effect when clicked


add level "themes" (ice world, fire world, etc etc each with its own challenges and powerups)
have it randomly select a level? or allow player to choose?
randomly generate the scene and theme
--------- Ice World ---------
freeze character for 2 seconds
ice blocks - invincible and -1 point? freeze if y > 3?
faster speed but ice is less dense

--------- Fire World ---------
smoke/haze effect?
lava blocks that damage and "freeze" player if touched

--------- Grass World ---------
vines?
swamp?

--------- Dark World ---------
Tiles can randomly change their alpha? to be "invisible"

--------- Lightning World ---------

--------- Volcano World ---------
magma geysers?
--------- Water World ---------
waterfalls?



*******POWER UP IDEAS************
super strength - one hit kills on tiles regardless of material (code: set clicks to 10 so its greater than all req. materials)
line clear
column clear
tri clear (3x3)
board clear
slow speed (code: GameManager.singleton.tileSpeed = X)




*********BAD THINGS**************
steam pocket - maybe cloud player vision?!
lava
monster?
cave in (all materials add  one?)
super speed (anti power up)
